## Description
This application & GitHub Action can generate and build Debian packages with ease. Simply provide the resources,
a configured file map and this app will generate for you a DEBIAN package with ease!
*Debian Packer* is ideal for applications that require Debian package to be dynamically generated, such as
part of an automated release with CI/CD.

This GitHub Action can optionally be used with another one of our projects,
[Debian Control File Builder](https://github.com/Nightwind-Developments/debian-control-file-builder), which can generate the required Debian Control File for this action, if you don't already have one.

## Usage
Here is a simple example of how you can use this Action in your Workflow:
### Simple Workflow
```yaml
name: Debian Packer Example

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deb-control-file-build:
    name: Generate Debian Package
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Generate Control File
        id: control-gen
        uses: Nightwind-Developments/debian-control-file-builder@latest
        with:
          config-file: 'examples/control_file_generate/example_control_template.json'
          deps-file: 'examples/control_file_generate/dependencies.txt'
          output-path: 'examples/input_example/'

      - name: Prints Output File Path
        run: echo "${{ steps.control-gen.outputs.control_file_path }}"

      - name: Confirms Control File is Present
        run: ls ${{ steps.control-gen.outputs.control_file_path }}

      #- name: Copies control File to Intended Location (useful if Debian Control file is not in the default location)
      #  run: cp ${{ steps.control-gen.outputs.control_file_path }} examples/input_example

      - name: Prints Contents of Input Resources
        run: ls -l examples/input_example/

      - name: Build Docker Container & Run Debian Packer
        uses: Nightwind-Developments/debian-packer@latest
        id: container
        with:
          input_dir: 'examples/input_example'
          output_dir: 'output'
          layout_map_file: 'examples/example-map.json'
          package_name: 'HelloWorld'
          package_version: '1.0.0'
          package_arch: 'all'

      - name: Upload Generated Package File
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: generated-hello-world-package
          path: "${{ steps.container.outputs.generated_package_path }}"
          if-no-files-found: error
```

### Input Parameters
| Name          | Type   | Required | Default                           | Description |
|---------------|--------|----------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| `input_dir` | String | Yes      | `${{ github.workspace }}/input/`  | Path to the directory with all the files to be included in the generated package |
| `layout_map_file`   | String | Yes       |                                   | Path to JSON configuration file with how to organise the build package directory |
| `package_name`   | String | Yes       |                                   | Name of the Package to be used in the file name |
| `package_version`   | String | Yes       |                                   | Version number of the Package to be used in the file name |
| `package_arch`   | String | No       |                                   | Architecture of the Package to be used in the file name |
| `output_dir` | String | No       | `${{ github.workspace }}/output/` | Directory path to where the generated package is intended to be saved |

Example use case for input parameters:
```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Step Name
      with:
        input-name: value
```

### Output Variables
| Name                | Type   | Description |
|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| `generated_package_path` | String | The configured path where the generated package is saved and can be retrieved |

Example use case for output variables:
```yaml
    steps:
    - name: Step Name
      id: step-id
      run: ./

    - name: Print Output Variable
      run echo "${{ steps.step-id.outputs.output_variable }}"
```

### JSON Layout Map File
A JSON File, formatted like below, can be used to specify the paths package files can be stored within the package, and subsequently post installation (with the exception of `DEBIAN`).

```JSON
[
  {
    "name": "control",
    "path": "/DEBIAN/"
  },
  {
    "name": "postinst",
    "path": "/DEBIAN/"
  },
  {
    "name": "hello_world",
    "path": "/usr/bin/"
  }
]
```

#### Input Example
All the files that are to be included package are to be in the root path of the specified `input_dir`. Currently input subdirectories are not yet supported.
</br>For example: In the case of the JSON file example above and the [Simple Workflow](#json-layout-map-file) example above, the input directory `input_example` should contain the following files in its root directory prior to running this Action:
```
  examples/input_example/
    |-- control
    |-- postinst
    |__ hello_world
```

#### Output Example
The following file structure will be present in the generated package using the configuration example above:
```
  .
  |-- DEBIAN
  |   |-- control
  |   |__ postinst
  |-- usr
  |   |-- bin
  |       |__ hello_world
```
